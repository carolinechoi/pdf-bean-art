# PDF Bean Art Project 🫘🖍

## Background:
While digging through Pinterest, I was deeply inspired by Lauren DiCoccio, a Bay Area artist who creates color typography by overlaying fluorescent paint over newspaper clippings. Lauren's interest in fiber and shapes led her to create what I am now calling "Bean Art" as a study in texture and circles. My hope was to build my own Bean Art but with the extra challenge of using code. 

While Lauren's work is a time-intensive labor of love, my Bean Art is computer generated. 

### Lauren's work:

### My work:

## To-Do:
- ~~modify code to recognize digits~~
- modify code to recognize standard punctuation
- shorten time complexity of the algorithm
- make a front-facing website so that it'll be easier for people to upload their PDFs
