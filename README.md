# PDF Bean Art Project 🫘🖍

## Background 🎨📌:
While digging through Pinterest, I was deeply inspired by Lauren DiCoccio, a Bay Area artist who creates color typography by overlaying fluorescent paint over newspaper clippings. Lauren's interest in fiber and shapes led her to create what I am now calling "Bean Art" as a study in texture and circles. My hope was to build my own Bean Art but with the extra challenge of using code. 

While Lauren's work is a time-intensive labor of love, my Bean Art is computer generated (and also a labor of love). 

### Lauren's work:

## How To Use ✨:
1. Download the "template.py" file.
2. Pick a ".pdf" file to convert.
3. Choose your color palette from https://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2007-4/walden/color.pdf. 
4. Fill in the template provided in the file, using "base.py" as an example.
5. Run in terminal!

## To-Do 🚞:
- ~~modify code to recognize digits~~
- ~~run program on more complex looking PDFs (ex: newspaper archives)~~
- modify code to recognize standard punctuation
- shorten time complexity of the algorithm
- make a front-facing website so that it'll be easier for people to upload their PDFs
